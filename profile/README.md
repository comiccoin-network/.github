## What is ComicCoin?
ComicCoin is an open-source and community-driven blockchain designed for comic collectors and creators. We're building an accessible ecosystem that connects fans with their favorite comics while empowering artists and publishers through blockchain technology.

## How is it different then other blockchains?
ComicCoin is a blockchain project utilizing a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism - this ensures fast, efficient, and environmentally friendly transactions while maintaining security and transparency. Our code is public, auditable, and community-driven.
